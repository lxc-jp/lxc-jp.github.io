        <h3>LXC 1.0.1 release announcement<p>6th of March 2014</p></h3>
        <p>This is the first bugfix release for the LXC 1.0 series.</p>

        <h4>Changes</h4>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>core: Detect the use of rshared / and properly work
                around it. This fixes LXC on systemd systems where the mount
                table would be duplicated in the container and
                lxc-attach wouldn't attach to the container's rootfs.</li>
            <li>core: Don't crash on invalid lxc.id_map</li>
            <li>core: Fix attaching when extra cgroups were setup
                after the container started</li>
            <li>core: Fix crash when rebooting container with phys
                interfaces</li>
            <li>core: Better detect and report permission problems</li>
            <li>core: Use common code for any unprivileged action, using
                newuidmap/newgidmap if available and only falling back
                to straight writes to uid_map/gid_map if they're not and
                the user is root</li>
            <li>core: Fix btrfs snapshot restore</li>
            <li>core: Fix race in the cloning code potentially leading
                to data loss</li>
            <li>core: Don't double-map the root uid/gid</li>
            <li>core: Fix snapshot restore for overlayfs</li>
            <li>core: Put logging variables in TLS</li>

            <li>apparmor: Stop using on-exec for profile changes as it's
                been proven unreliable on overlayfs at least</li>
            <li>bash completion: Remove wrong shebang</li>
            <li>cgmanager: Don't keep an active connection after
                container start</li>
            <li>cgmanager: Fix to work with threads</li>
            <li>doc: Update README</li>
            <li>lua: Respect --prefix</li>
            <li>lxc-create: Fix the dir backend to actually respect --dir</li>
            <li>lxc-device: Properly support wlan devices</li>
            <li>lxc-ls: Fix --nesting function to work with unprivileged
                containers</li>
            <li>lxc-start-ephemeral: Set the tmpfs as 0755 instead of 0777</li>
            <li>python3: Export missing get_global_config_item function</li>
            <li>seccomp: Catch violations by init</li>
            <li>systemd: Fix unit file location</li>
            <li>templates: Detect system containers inside
                unprivileged containers (lxc-download)</li>
            <li>tests: Fix potential hang in lxc-test-concurent</li>
            <li>upstart: Don't forward requests for LXC_DOMAIN (dnsmasq)</li>
          </ul>

        <h3>LXC 1.0.0 release announcement<p>20th of February 2014</p></h3>
        <h4>Introduction</h4>
        <p>It's with great pleasure that the LXC team is announcing the
           release of LXC 1.0!
        </p>

        <p>This release is a significant milestone for us as it marks the first
           release we consider to be production ready.  It features a
           wide variety of improvements to container security, a
           consistent set of tools, updated documentation and an API
           with multiple bindings.
        </p>

        <p>Over 60 people contributed their time to this release, making
           it the best LXC release yet!  The result of all that work can
           be seen used in areas as diverse as individual laptops,
           cellphones and cloud instances.  And we are confident that
           with LXC 1.0, we will see LXC's usage expand even more and be used
           for a lot of new and exciting projects.
        </p>

        <h4>Downloads</h4>
        <p>The release tarballs may be found on our
           <a href="/downloads">download page</a> and we expect most
           distributions will very soon ship a packaged version of LXC 1.0.
        </p>

        <p>Should you be interested in individual changes or just
           looking at the detailed development history, our main repository is
           on <a href="https://github.com/lxc/lxc">Github</a>.
        </p>

        <h4>New features</h4>
        <p>LXC 1.0 is the result of 10 months of development and over a
           thousand commits, including a major rework of the way LXC is
           structured.  It's therefore near impossible to come up with a
           comprehensive list of changes in this release, however here are
           some highlights:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Support for fully unprivileged containers</li>
          <li>Public stable API (liblxc1)</li>
          <li>Official API bindings for lua and python3 (in tree)</li>
          <li>Official API bindings for
              <a href="https://github.com/lxc/go-lxc">Go</a> and
              <a href="https://github.com/lxc/ruby-lxc">ruby</a>
              (out of tree)</li>
          <li>Flexible backingstore system with support for:
              <ul>
                <li>standard directories (default)</li>
                <li>btrfs</li>
                <li>zfs</li>
                <li>lvm</li>
                <li>loop devices</li>
                <li>aufs</li>
                <li>overlayfs</li>
              </ul></li>
          <li>Support for cloning and snapshotting containers</li>
          <li>A reduced but more complete set of command line tools</li>
          <li>Updated, more complete documentation</li>
          <li>A new way of creating containers based on centrally
              generated images</li>
          <li>Templates letting you create containers running most
              popular distributions</li>
        </ul>

        <p>A series of blog posts introducing you to LXC and highlighting
           some of LXC 1.0's new features may be found
           <a href="https://www.stgraber.org/2013/12/20/lxc-1-0-blog-post-series/">here</a>.
        </p>


        <h4>LXC 1.0 moving forward</h4>
        <p>LXC 1.0 is the first production ready release of LXC and it
           comes with a commitment from upstream to maintain it until at
           least Ubuntu 14.04 LTS reaches end of life in April 2019.
           That's slightly over 5 years of support!</p>

        <p>We will be maintaining a separate stable branch and will
           cherry-pick and backport fixes as appropriate.  It's expected
           that we will have frequent bugfix releases of 1.0 so
           distributions can simply use those and save themselves the
           trouble of having to manually follow our stable branch.
         </p>

        <h4>Bug reports and contact information</h4>
        <p>Bug reports should be filed on
           <a href="https://github.com/lxc/lxc/issues">Github</a>
           or if you do not wish to create an account, by e-mail to the
           appropriate
           <a href="https://lists.linuxcontainers.org"> mailing-list</a>.
           The same goes for your patches. We tend to prefer patches
           sent to lxc-devel but we also accept pull request directly on
           Github.
        </p>

        <p>LXC 1.0 is also the first release after the change of project
           maintainers which occurred in September 2013. We'd like to thank
           Daniel Lezcano for all the great work and efforts he's put in
           LXC over the years and wish him the best of luck in his new
           projects!</p>

        <p>The current projects maintainers are
           <a href="http://s3hh.wordpress.com">Serge Hallyn</a>
           and <a href="https://www.stgraber.org">St&eacute;phane Graber</a>.
