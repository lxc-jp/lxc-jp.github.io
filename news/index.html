        <h3>LXC 1.0.3 release announcement<p>8th of April 2014</p></h3>
        <p>This is the third bugfix release for the LXC 1.0 series.</p>

        <h4>Changes</h4>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>core: Always initialize netpipe in lxc_spawn.</li>
            <li>core: Move lxc-monitord.log to LOGPATH instead of LXCPATH.</li>
            <li>core: Make monitord more resilient to unexpected
                termination.</li>
            <li>core: Move lxc-init to /sbin/init.lxc instead of the
                architecture/distro specific multiarch path. Use path
                lookup to find it in the container rather than using an
                hardcoded path.</li>
            <li>core: Set macvlan default mode to private.</li>
            <li>core: Check whether rootfs is shared before running the
                pre-mount hooks.</li>

            <li>apparmor: Update the profiles for current upstream
                apparmor. This includes tweak to the pivot_root targets
                and the addition of the ptrace and signal stanzas. Users
                of older apparmor versions may want to comment the dbus,
                ptrace and signal stanzas if the parser fails to parse
                the profile.</li>
            <li>apparmor: Use an intermediary profile which allows for
                easier generation of complex rules. This discovered a
                few problems with the existing profile which has now
                been fixed. Most of /proc/sys is now properly blocked
                with exceptions for kernel/shm/*, net/*,
                kernel/domainname and kernel/hostname.</li>
            <li>apparmor: block cgroupfs by default in the with-nesting
                profile, users should now be using cgmanager which
                doesn't required this.</li>
            <li>cgmanager: Fix a small cgm_get bug when len == 0.</li>
            <li>lxc-info: Don't print duplicate lines.</li>
            <li>sysvinit script: Fix wait_for_bridge to better parse
                default.conf</li>
            <li>tools: Don't exit -1, instead use more conventional and
                consistent exit codes 0 on success, 1 on failure with
                some (now documented) exceptions for lxc-start.</li>

            <li>archlinux template: Add debugging info for missing
                network link.</li>
            <li>archlinux template: Various fixes and cleanups.</li>
            <li>centos template: Properly set lxc.arch.</li>
            <li>download template: Make it a bit more resilient to
                download failures.</li>
            <li>fedora template: Properly set lxc.arch.</li>
            <li>gentoo template: Make sure sshd is started.</li>
            <li>gentoo template: Fix lack of generated locales.</li>
            <li>gentoo template: Fix lxc-console by setting up a tty.</li>
            <li>oracle template: Fix upgrade problems by introducing a
                patch script that's run on upgrade.</li>

            <li>tests: Add a test for the apparmor profiles.</li>
            <li>tests: Bump timeouts to fix occasional failures on slow
                ARM builders.</li>
            <li>tests: Always propagate http_proxy and https_proxy.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <h4>Downloads</h4>
        <p>The release tarballs may be found on our
           <a href="/downloads">download page</a> and we expect most
           distributions will very soon ship a packaged version of LXC 1.0.3.
        </p>

           looking at the detailed development history, our stable branch is

        <h4>Changes</h4>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>core: Detect the use of rshared / and properly work
                around it. This fixes LXC on systemd systems where the mount
                table would be duplicated in the container and
                lxc-attach wouldn't attach to the container's rootfs.</li>
            <li>core: Don't crash on invalid lxc.id_map</li>

                interfaces</li>
            <li>core: Better detect and report permission problems</li>
            <li>core: Use common code for any unprivileged action, using
                newuidmap/newgidmap if available and only falling back
                to straight writes to uid_map/gid_map if they're not and
                the user is root</li>
            <li>core: Fix btrfs snapshot restore</li>
            <li>core: Fix race in the cloning code potentially leading
                to data loss</li>
            <li>core: Don't double-map the root uid/gid</li>
            <li>core: Fix snapshot restore for overlayfs</li>

            <li>apparmor: Stop using on-exec for profile changes as it's
                been proven unreliable on overlayfs at least</li>
            <li>bash completion: Remove wrong shebang</li>
            <li>cgmanager: Don't keep an active connection after
                container start</li>
            <li>cgmanager: Fix to work with threads</li>
            <li>doc: Update README</li>
            <li>lua: Respect --prefix</li>
            <li>lxc-create: Fix the dir backend to actually respect --dir</li>
            <li>lxc-device: Properly support wlan devices</li>
            <li>lxc-ls: Fix --nesting function to work with unprivileged
                containers</li>
            <li>lxc-start-ephemeral: Set the tmpfs as 0755 instead of 0777</li>
            <li>python3: Export missing get_global_config_item function</li>
            <li>seccomp: Catch violations by init</li>
            <li>systemd: Fix unit file location</li>
            <li>templates: Detect system containers inside
                unprivileged containers (lxc-download)</li>
            <li>tests: Fix potential hang in lxc-test-concurent</li>
            <li>upstart: Don't forward requests for LXC_DOMAIN (dnsmasq)</li>

        <h3>LXC 1.0.0 release announcement<p>20th of February 2014</p></h3>
        <h4>Introduction</h4>
        <p>It's with great pleasure that the LXC team is announcing the
           release of LXC 1.0!
        </p>

        <p>This release is a significant milestone for us as it marks the first
           release we consider to be production ready.  It features a
           wide variety of improvements to container security, a
           consistent set of tools, updated documentation and an API
           with multiple bindings.
        </p>

        <p>Over 60 people contributed their time to this release, making
           it the best LXC release yet!  The result of all that work can
           be seen used in areas as diverse as individual laptops,
           cellphones and cloud instances.  And we are confident that
           with LXC 1.0, we will see LXC's usage expand even more and be used
           for a lot of new and exciting projects.
        </p>

        <h4>Downloads</h4>
        <p>The release tarballs may be found on our
           <a href="/downloads">download page</a> and we expect most
           distributions will very soon ship a packaged version of LXC 1.0.
        </p>

        <p>Should you be interested in individual changes or just
           looking at the detailed development history, our main repository is
           on <a href="https://github.com/lxc/lxc">Github</a>.
        </p>

        <h4>New features</h4>
        <p>LXC 1.0 is the result of 10 months of development and over a
           thousand commits, including a major rework of the way LXC is
           structured.  It's therefore near impossible to come up with a
           comprehensive list of changes in this release, however here are
           some highlights:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Support for fully unprivileged containers</li>
          <li>Public stable API (liblxc1)</li>
          <li>Official API bindings for lua and python3 (in tree)</li>
          <li>Official API bindings for
              <a href="https://github.com/lxc/go-lxc">Go</a> and
              <a href="https://github.com/lxc/ruby-lxc">ruby</a>
              (out of tree)</li>
          <li>Flexible backingstore system with support for:
              <ul>
                <li>standard directories (default)</li>
                <li>btrfs</li>
                <li>zfs</li>
                <li>lvm</li>
                <li>loop devices</li>
                <li>aufs</li>
                <li>overlayfs</li>
              </ul></li>
          <li>Support for cloning and snapshotting containers</li>
          <li>A reduced but more complete set of command line tools</li>
          <li>Updated, more complete documentation</li>
          <li>A new way of creating containers based on centrally
              generated images</li>
          <li>Templates letting you create containers running most
              popular distributions</li>
        </ul>

        <p>A series of blog posts introducing you to LXC and highlighting
           some of LXC 1.0's new features may be found
           <a href="https://www.stgraber.org/2013/12/20/lxc-1-0-blog-post-series/">here</a>.
        </p>


        <h4>LXC 1.0 moving forward</h4>
        <p>LXC 1.0 is the first production ready release of LXC and it
           comes with a commitment from upstream to maintain it until at
           least Ubuntu 14.04 LTS reaches end of life in April 2019.
           That's slightly over 5 years of support!</p>

        <p>We will be maintaining a separate stable branch and will
           cherry-pick and backport fixes as appropriate.  It's expected
           that we will have frequent bugfix releases of 1.0 so
           distributions can simply use those and save themselves the
           trouble of having to manually follow our stable branch.
         </p>

        <h4>Bug reports and contact information</h4>
        <p>Bug reports should be filed on
           <a href="https://github.com/lxc/lxc/issues">Github</a>
           or if you do not wish to create an account, by e-mail to the
           appropriate
           <a href="https://lists.linuxcontainers.org"> mailing-list</a>.
           The same goes for your patches. We tend to prefer patches
           sent to lxc-devel but we also accept pull request directly on
           Github.
        </p>

        <p>LXC 1.0 is also the first release after the change of project
           maintainers which occurred in September 2013. We'd like to thank
           Daniel Lezcano for all the great work and efforts he's put in
           LXC over the years and wish him the best of luck in his new
           projects!</p>

        <p>The current projects maintainers are
           <a href="http://s3hh.wordpress.com">Serge Hallyn</a>
           and <a href="https://www.stgraber.org">St&eacute;phane Graber</a>.
